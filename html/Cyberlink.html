<h1><a id="theproblem">A Plague is Coming...</h1>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<h3>Rats are stowing away on the Silk Road travelers’ items with the fleas containing the plague. They come through the silk road to your home from central Asia. People aren’t being clean and are keeping their houses dirty. By doing so, you attract rats with fleas on them to come into your houses. This is a big problem since the flea on the rats have the plague. Since the flea drinks the blood of the rodents, they will take your blood when the rats run out of the blood and die. When the flea   <a id="thesolution">takes your blood, you won’t feel it, and won’t know if they even did. During the process, they unknowingly give you the plague.</h3>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<h3>To avoid the Bubonic Plague, you need to maintain your health and hygiene. People have to take baths and showers everyday at least twice and have to wash their hands a lot of times every day. Remove brush, rock piles, junk, cluttered firewood, and possible rodent food supplies, such as pet and wild animal food. Make your home and outbuildings rodent-proof. Wear gloves if you are handling or skinning potentially infected animals to prevent contact between your skin and the plague bacteria. <a id="lifelesson">People with the virus should isolate themselves so they don’t infect other people. People who don’t have the virus should avoid the people with the virus and should isolate themselves in their houses.</h3>
<h2>Life Lesson</h2>
<h3>The reign of the Bubonic Plague ended because more and more people started isolating themselves and so they stopped getting infected. In all this, people learnt that it's very important that you maintain your hygiene and keep your houses clean. When you keep yourself and the area around yourself clean, it gives you more positive energy<a id="quiz"> and reduces chances of you getting diseases.</h3><br>
<h2>Quiz</h2>
<h3>How many people will the plague kill if we aren't hygienic?</h3>
